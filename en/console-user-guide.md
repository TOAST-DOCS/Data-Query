### 1. Cluster Area

* You can turn the cluster on or off.
* In order to reflect the added, changed, and deleted data source information to actual activity, DataQuery cluster have to be restarted. 
* If a data source has been added, changed, deleted, the Restart Cluster message appears as shown below.
* It may take 1~2 minutes to turn off and 5~7 minutes to turn on.
* DataQuery cluster reflects all data sources and cannot apply individual data sources.
* If Cluster **on** or **off** persists to fail, contact the Customer Center.

### 2. Schema Area

* You can check data sources that are connected and the actual DB, tables, and column information that they provide.
    * Information\_schema is DB that has connection information with the data source and cannot be tempered.
* Click Refresh for respective item to refresh data sources, schema, tables, and column information.
    * However, refreshing parent Schema does not reload the child Schema information. When you refresh Table, only its Table list is imported and respective columnâ€™s information is not to be updated.

### 3. Saved Query Area

* You can manage queries saved by users.
* Click **Open** to import the query you saved in the currently open query editor area.
* Click **Open New Tab** to import the query you saved in the new query editor area.

    * Trino does not have data on its own, and processes data through linking with multiple data sources.
        * Exceptional grammar or restrictions may exist for each data source.
    *It is designed for Analytical Processing (OLAP) operations, not Transaction Processing (OLTP) operations.
* Data type
    * Supports types such as BOOLEAN, integer, decimal, string, date, UUID, hyperlog, etc.
* Trino Query
    * Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML) and additional syntax are supported as below.
        * Syntax to check Metadata: SHOW CATALOGS, SHOW SCHEMAS, SHOW TABLES, SHOW STATS FOR
        * Syntax to check system's embedded procedure or to check execution plan of Query: CALL, EXPLAIN
* See Trino's Guide for more information.
    * [Keyword, Data Type](https://trino.io/docs/462/language.html)
    * [Trino Query](https://trino.io/docs/462/sql.html)

* Default Recipient
    * A member with the DataQuery ADMIN role in the project where the DataQuery service you are using is enabled

## Data Source Detailed Guide

### Run Object Storage Data Source Query

* Queries for Object Storage data sources are based on Trino-Hive.
    * Hive is solution to support SQL job processing in [Apache Hadoop](https://hive.apache.org/) distributed storage environments.
* DataQuery uses S3-compatible layer for Object Storage access and requires use of s3a protocol when specifying path for data for Schemas or Tables (ex. s3a://example/test).
* Supports processing of Parquet, JSON, ORC, CSV, and Text types of Data on Object Storage.
* Object Storage data source provides default Schema named Default, and you can work in the corresponding schema.
> [Note]
> If you need performance improvements for Hive used for Object Storage queries, please contact the Custoer Center.

#### Additional Grammar to operate Hive feature  

* Trino-Hive basically follows standard SQL grammar, but there is additional feature/Grammar for Hive activity response. [Details](https://trino.io/docs/462/connector/hive.html)
* Supported data format
    * Default format is designated as ORC, and you can specify Parquet, JSON, ORC, CSV, Text, etc. as Settings.
    * When creating Table, you can specify Format value in With clause.

``` sql
 CREATE TABLE sample (...) WITH ( format = 'type')
```

* Table Type
    * Managed Table
        * Table data is managed on specified path (datquery-warehouse bucket) at the time of DB creation.
        * Deleting a table also deletes table information and files stored in Object Storage.
        * If you not specify separate option when creating a table, it is to be created as an internal table.
    * External Table
        * It works based on data located in separate path that user specified.
        * When deleting a table, unlike internal table, the associated data source is not deleted. 
        * When creating a table, you must specify the path of data in the external\_location of WITH clause.
          * When entering the path of external_location data, the bucket (container) name must comply with [NHN Cloud Object Storage's Bucket Naming Rules](https://docs.toast.com/ko/Storage/Object%20Storage/ko/s3-api-guide/#_7).

``` sql
# Managed Table Sample
 CREATE TABLE sample (...);
# External Table Sample
 CREATE TABLE sample (...) WITH ( external_location = 's3a://<Bucket, Container name>/<Data Directory Path>/');
```

* Partition
    * Hive provides partitioning features that allow to separate and store data into specific criteria directories.
    * To apply partitions to Tables or manipulate Partitions, the following query is required:

``` sql
# Create by applying partition to the table
CREATE TABLE default.sample (...) WITH ( partitioned_by = ARRAY['columna', 'columnb'],)
# Query partition
SELECT * FROM default"sample$partitions"
# Control partition
system.create_empty_partition(schema_name, table_name, partition_columns, partition_values)
system.sync_partition_metadata(schema_name, table_name, mode, case_sensitive)
system.register_partition(schema_name, table_name, partition_columns, partition_values, location)
```
* Partition procedure
  * sync_partition_metadata
    * You can automatically register and delete partition values by inferring partition values from the paths of objects.
      
      | Mode | Description                                                                                |
      | ----- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | ADD | Add a partition value when the partition value is not registered in the table and the Object Storage objects exist against the Hive partition path. |
      | DROP | If the partition value is already registered in the table, but the Object Storage objects do not exist in the Hive partition path, delete the partition value. |
      | FULL | Perform ADD and DROP.                                                            |
    * Here's how to infer the Hive partition value based on the paths of Object Storage objects.
      * Retrieve all objects under the defined external_location and extracts the path.
      * If the partition columns are specified as columns c1 and c2, a valid path to a Hive partition must contain `/c1=<c1 value>/c2=<c2 value>`.
      * For example, if you have a table defined as external_location='s3a://location/tmp/', partitioned_by=ARRAY['year', 'month', 'day'], and if the paths of all objects under external_location contain the same format as s3a://location/tmp/year=yyyy/month=MM/day=dd/, the Hive partition path is determined as 'valid', inferring the partition value.
   * [Caution]
      * To run sync_partition_metadata, one more path must be below the container in the external\_location defined in the table. For example, when the container is location, such as external\_location='s3a://location/tmp/', there must be one more path to tmp below the container.
  * register_partition
    * You can directly register a user-specified path as the value of a partition.
    * In the third parameter, partition_columns, enter the partition columns that you defined in the Hive table.
    * In the fourth parameter, partition_values, enter the partition values you want to register.
    * At least one object must exist in the fifth parameter, location.
* Restrictions
    * Table columns of CSV type are supported for VARCHAR type only.
    * DataQuery uses S3-compatible layer for Object Storage access and requires use of s3a protocol when specifying path for data for schemas or tables (ex. s3a://example/test).
    * Data directory path object specified by external\_location in External Table have to be existed separately.
        * With the directory created separately in Object Storage, the data must be located in the corresponding directory for normal link.
        * If having issues with the processing, please contact the Customer Center.
    * If external\_location path name of external table contains Korean characters, the data will not be processed properly.
    * If Object Storage bucket associated with table is deleted, the Table DROP query fails.
    * DELETE, UPDATE can only be performed on partition data on limited basis.
        * [Details](https://trino.io/docs/462/connector/hive.html#data-management)

#### External Table Query Utilization Tutorial

1. [Download](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_dataquery/files/facility-boundary-us-all.csv) the sample CSV file and upload to Object Storage.

7. Run the query from the table as follows.

``` SQL
SELECT * FROM corona_facility_us
        WHERE facility_place_id = 'ChIJkxHDPsnTQIYR7MH7N-eIdQ0'
          AND facility_latitude = '29.952'
```

8. Check if the total of 10 data are displayed normally.

| partitioning | Specifies the table partition. If the table is partitioned into columns c1 and c2, you can specify partitioning=ARRAY['c1', 'c2']. |
| sorted_by | When saving individual data files, sort them by the values in the columns you specify. |
| location | Specify the Object Storage path for the table.<br>If the property is not set, it is stored in the schema path under the default path. |

#### Partitions

* Table properties allow you to create partitioned (partitioned) tables in a structure where the table data is stored partitioned.
    * If the partition columns are specified as columns C1 and C2, the data in those partitions is stored at `/C1=<C1 value>/C2=<C2 value>` down the table data path.
* You can't add/manage partitions manually because Iceberg automatically manages partitions based on the value of the data written to them.
* Supports the feature to specify partitions using (transforming) table columns.
    * [More about](https://trino.io/docs/462/connector/iceberg.html#partitioned-tables) year, month, day, hour, bucket, truncate

| Convert | Supported type | Description |
| --- | ----- | --- |
| year(ts) | DATE, TIMESTAMP | Yearly |
| month(ts) | DATE, TIMESTAMP | Monthly |
| day(ts) | DATE, TIMESTAMP | Daily |
| hour(ts) | TIMESTAMP | Hourly |

#### Metadata Table

* You can view metadata for an Iceberg table by looking up the metadata table. [Additional information](https://trino.io/docs/462/connector/iceberg.html#metadata-tables)
    * $properties
        * Table Properties
    * $history
        * History of metadata changes to a table
    * $snapshots
        * A history of table geometry recorded as changes occur in the data.
    * $manifests
        * Information about the file that manages the bundle of data files
    * $partitions
        * Detailed partition information for a table
    * $files
        * A snapshot of the current table

```sql
## Get table properties
SELECT * FROM "test_table$properties"
```

#### Data Management

* Registering a table
    * This is how to register an Iceberg table that already exists as a file, but is not registered.
    * You can register by calling register_table.

```sql
CALL example.system.register_table(schema_name => 'example_schema', table_name => 'example_table', table_location => 's3a://my-bucket/example_schema/example_table')
```

* Deleting a table
    * You can drop a table with the DROP TABLE statement. This command deletes the actual Iceberg data.
* Exclude tables
    * This can be used to exclude a table from a list of tables only, without dropping it (DROP).

```sql
CALL example.system.unregister_table(schema_name => 'example_schema', table_name => 'example_table')
```

* Schema evolution
    * Iceberg supports schema evolution, which changes only metadata. The data files themselves do not change when you perform a schema update.
    * Supports adding, deleting, reordering, renaming, and changing the type of columns.
    * Type changes only support changes to types that extend from existing types.
        * INTEGER to BIGINT
        * REAL to DOUBLE
        * Increasing the precision of DECIMAL
* Organizing snapshots
    * Clean up snapshots created by writes, changes, compression, etc.
    * You can maintain the size of your metadata by removing unnecessary information and data files.
    * To keep the size of your table metadata small, it's a good idea to clean up your snapshots regularly.

```sql
ALTER TABLE test_table EXECUTE expire_snapshots(retention_threshold => '7d')
```

* Clean up orphan files
    * Delete data files that are no longer relevant to the metadata that currently exists.
        * Deletes targets that were created before the specified time among those files.
    * To manage the size of your table's data directory, we recommend that you clean up your files.

```sql
ALTER TABLE test_table EXECUTE remove_orphan_files(retention_threshold => '7d')
```

#### Iceberg Type Information

* Iceberg types map to types that can be processed by DataQuery, as shown below.

| DataQuery Type | Iceberg type |
| ----------- | --------- |
| BOOLEAN | BOOLEAN |
| INTEGER | INT |
| BIGINT | LONG |
| REAL | FLOAT |
| DOUBLE | DOUBLE |
| DECIMAL(p,s) | DECIMAL(p,s) |
| DATE | DATE |
| TIME(6) | TIME |
| TIMESTAMP(6) | TIMESTAMP |
| TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE | TIMESTAMPTZ |
| VARCHAR | STRING |
| UUID | UUID |
| VARBINARY | BINARY |
| ROW(...) | STRUCT(...) |
| ARRAY(e) | LIST(e) |
| MAP(k,v) | MAP(k,v) |

#### Add Parquet Files that Exist in Object Storage to the Iceberg Table
* You can add specific files or files under a specific path as data to an Iceberg table.
* You can add data files and partition values with add_files for tables without partitions and add_files_with_partition for tables with defined partitions.
* add_files procedure

```
#### Cautions and Constraints

* It is not possible to create duplicate Iceberg tables in the same path.
* When converting columns to organize partitions, you can't use the same columns.
    * Example: You cannot set up two partitions, year and month, with columns that have a single DATE type.

#### FAQ

* Iceberg data already exists in Object Storage. How can I apply it to a DataQuery?
    * You can register by running register_table. See Data management > Register a table.
* Only Parquet files exist in Object Storage. How can I make them into Iceberg tables?
    * After creating an Iceberg table, you can add data using the add_files and add_files_with_partition procedures.
* I want to add only Parquet data to an Iceberg table that already exists.
    * You can add data using the add_files, add_files_with_partition procedures.
